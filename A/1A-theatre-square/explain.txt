please note that the mod of a number smaller than the other like 4%5 will equall the same number 4
i use the mod there as a way to make the size of the rectangle dividable on the size of the square so i could
find a way or a limit to calculate the count of the square

the second way of thinking is to count starting from the width and for each cycle we will count each row and mines each
one by the length of that square untill the width is < 0 i didn't but it <= 0 because in that cause i will get extra square
if width is 4 and the square is 2 then the number of square in the row will be 3 because for each iteration ->4 2 0 -2

the question is like if i have a width let say 5 how many peice i can devide or put in it if the peice length is 1
let 's say 5 /1 is 5 so i can fit 5 peices in the widht but what if the peice is 2 then i can fit 2.5 and as we know in the
question we can't fit half a square so we could add a half so it become 3

knowing that we can divde the width on the square width and the height on the height of the square and take the ceil of each value
and then multipli it so we get the size of the square i can fit


// for (int i = input[2]; i <= input[0] + input[0] % input[2]; i += input[2])
// {
//     for (int j = input[2]; j <= (input[1] + input[1] % input[2]); j += input[2])
//     {
//         count++;
//     }
// }
