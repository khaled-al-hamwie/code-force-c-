so when thinking about it is like the theatre square where you have a rectangle and you want to fill it with square
but the difference here that the deminsion of the peice we want to fill with is not 1 it is 2 to 1 and we can fill it in any 
diraction and it we don't want to fill it fully and has a peice outside of the rectangle

so i solve it by looking at the bigger edge of the rectangle and in my cause N 
then i calculate the largest number of peice i can fit / which mean divide N on A 
and the result is either 0 or the rest of the division which will be called Rest_of_N

then we do the same for the height M 
we divide M on the B and then get the Rest_of_M

then we see how many peice i can fit in the Rest_of_N by dividing it on M like the previous 


you can use the formula 
(N/A) * (M/B) to get how many small rectangle can fit in the largest rectangle
